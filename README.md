This is a supplementary R Markdown workbook (Supplementary Text 1) containing code to reproduce all main figures and analyses in the associated paper, as well as several supplementary files. Code can be shown or hidden overall (see top right) or for individual sections. 

Code can be altered to change any of the figures.  Some explanatory text is provided, but not much. Any questions can be addressed via email (liam.philip.shaw@gmail.com). 

Unless otherwise stated, data related to viruses is plotted in <span style="color:red">red</span> and bacteria in black. The code should take <10 minutes to run on a standard laptop. 

**Note:** At several points code is adapted/reused from the supplementary code repository made available by Olival et. al. (2017):

* Olival et al. (2017) paper: *Host and viral traits predict zoonotic spillover from mammals*  https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22975

This mainly applies to several scripts in the `scripts' directory relating to the fitting and plotting of generalized additive models (GAMs) -- more information is included where appropriate. All code here is also made available under the MIT License.
